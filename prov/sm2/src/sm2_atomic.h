/* This file provides shims between the opal atomics interface and the C11 atomics
 * interface. It is intended as the first step in moving to using C11 atomics across the
 * entire codebase. Once all officially supported compilers offer C11 atomic (GCC 4.9.0+,
 * icc 2018+, pgi, xlc, etc) then this shim will go away and the codebase will be updated
 * to use C11's atomic support directly. This shim contains some functions already present
 * in atomic_impl.h because we do not include atomic_impl.h when using C11 atomics. It
 * would require alot of #ifdefs to avoid duplicate definitions to be worthwhile. */
